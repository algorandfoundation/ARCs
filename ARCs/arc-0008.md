# Algorand Wallet Sign and Post API

> This API is a draft.
> Some elements may change.

## Summary

An API for a function used to simultaneously sign and post transactions to the network.

## Abstract

A function `signAndPostTxns`, which accepts an array of `WalletTransaction`s, and posts them to the network.

Accepts the inputs to [ARC-0005](arc-0005.md)'s `signTxns`, and produces the output of [ARC-0007](arc-0007.md)'s `postTxns`.

## Specification

### Interface `SignAndPostTxnsFunction`

```ts
export type SignAndPostTxnsFunction = (
   txns: WalletTransaction[],
   opts?: any,
) => Promise<PostTxnsResult>;
```

* `WalletTransaction` is as specified by [ARC-0005](arc-0005.md).
* `PostTxnsResult` is as specified by [ARC-0007](arc-0007.md).

Errors are handled exactly as specified by [ARC-0001](arc-0001.md) / [ARC-0005](arc-0005.md) and [ARC-0007](arc-0007.md)

## Rationale

Allows the user to be sure that what they are signing is in fact all that is being sent. Doesn't necessarily grant the DApp direct access to the signed txns, though they are posted to the network, so they should not be considered private.

Exposing only this API instead of exposing `postTxns` directly is potentially safer for the wallet user, since it only allows the posting of transactions which the user has explicitly approved.
