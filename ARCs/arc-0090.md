## Abstract

This ARC defines a unified Algorand URI scheme that covers payment transactions, key registration, application NoOp calls, and read-only blockchain queries. It expands on earlier URI specifications to support deeplinks, QR codes, and other contexts where structured URIs communicate transaction intent or state queries.

## Motivation

This ARC consolidates and supersedes [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md), [ARC-78](./arc-0078.md), [ARC-79](./arc-0079.md), and [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md). Unifying their technical details avoids divergence across implementations, ensures extensions share consistent encoding rules, and provides a single reference for wallet, application, and tooling authors.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

Algorand URIs follow the general format for URIs as set forth in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>. The path component consists of an Algorand address, and the query component provides additional parameters specific to the encoded intent.

### ABNF Overview

The productions below consolidate the syntax for all Algorand URI variants. Scheme-specific sections reference these shared rules when describing their parameters.

```abnf
; Core
algorandaddress   = *base32
appid             = *digit
assetid           = *digit
; qchar corresponds to RFC 3986 query characters excluding "=" and "&"
; qbase64url matches the unpadded base64url alphabet from RFC 4648 section 5
qbase64url        = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
alabel            = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / ".")
noteparam         = "note=" *qchar
xnote             = "xnote=" *qchar
feeparam          = "fee=" *digit
otherparam        = qchar *qchar [ "=" *qchar ]

; Network authority selectors
netauth           = ghlabel / netlabel
ghlabel           = "gh:" 1*qbase64url
netlabel          = "net:" ( "testnet" / "betanet" / alabel )

; Payment transactions (ARC-26)
paymenturn        = "algorand://" [ netauth "/" ] algorandaddress [ "?" paymentparams ]
paymentparams     = paymentparam *( "&" paymentparam )
paymentparam      = amountparam / labelparam / noteparam / xnote / assetparam / otherparam
amountparam       = "amount=" *digit
labelparam        = "label=" *qchar
assetparam        = "asset=" *digit

; Key registration transactions (ARC-78)
keyregurn         = "algorand://" [ netauth "/" ] algorandaddress [ "?" keyregparams ]
keyregparams      = keyregparam *( "&" keyregparam )
keyregparam       = typekeyreg / votekeyparam / selkeyparam / sprfkeyparam / votefstparam / votelstparam / votekdparam / noteparam / xnote / feeparam / otherparam
typekeyreg        = "type=keyreg"
votekeyparam      = "votekey=" *qbase64url
selkeyparam       = "selkey=" *qbase64url
sprfkeyparam      = "sprfkey=" *qbase64url
votefstparam      = "votefst=" *digit
votelstparam      = "votelst=" *digit
votekdparam       = "votekdkey=" *digit

; Application NoOp call transactions (ARC-79)
noopurn           = "algorand://" [ netauth "/" ] algorandaddress [ "?" noopparams ]
noopparams        = noopparam *( "&" noopparam )
noopparam         = typeappl / appparam / methodparam / argparam / boxparam / assetparam / accountparam / feeparam / noteparam / xnote / otherparam
typeappl          = "type=appl"
appparam          = "app=" *digit
methodparam       = "method=" *qchar
argparam          = "arg=" *qchar
boxparam          = "box=" *qbase64url
accountparam      = "account=" *base32

; Application state queries (ARC-82 application mode)
appqueryurn       = "algorand://" [ netauth "/" ] "app/" appid [ "?" appqueryparams ]
appqueryparams    = appqueryparam *( "&" appqueryparam )
appqueryparam     = boxparam / globalparam / localparam / algaddrparam / tealcodeparam / otherparam
globalparam       = "global=" *qbase64url
localparam        = "local=" *qbase64url
algaddrparam      = "algorandaddress=" *base32
tealcodeparam     = "tealcode"

; Asset metadata queries (ARC-82 asset mode)
assetqueryurn     = "algorand://" [ netauth "/" ] "asset/" assetid [ "?" assetqueryparams ]
assetqueryparams  = assetqueryparam *( "&" assetqueryparam )
assetqueryparam   = totalparam / decimalsparam / frozenparam / unitnameparam / assetnameparam / urlparam / metadatahashparam / managerparam / reserveparam / freezeparam / clawbackparam / otherparam
totalparam        = "total"
decimalsparam     = "decimals"
frozenparam       = "frozen"
unitnameparam     = "unitname"
assetnameparam    = "assetname"
urlparam          = "url"
metadatahashparam = "metadatahash"
managerparam      = "manager"
reserveparam      = "reserve"
freezeparam       = "freeze"
clawbackparam     = "clawback"
```

Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range. These must first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986.

Here, "qchar" corresponds to valid characters of an RFC 3986 URI query component, excluding the "=" and "&" characters, which this specification takes as separators.

The scheme component ("algorand:") is case-insensitive, and implementations MUST accept any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The rest of the URI is case-sensitive, including the query parameter keys.

!!! Caveat
    When it comes to generation of an address' QR, many exchanges and wallets encode the address without the scheme component ("algorand:"). This is not a URI so it is OK.

### Common URI Format

#### Network Selection via Authority

All Algorand URI variants encode the target network in the authority component instead of relying on query parameters. The authority, when present, MUST use one of the following prefixes:

- `gh:<base64url>`: Authoritative selector carrying the unpadded base64url encoding (per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html#section-5">RFC 4648 section 5</a>) of the 32-byte genesis hash. Clients MUST validate and honor this selector.
- `net:<alias>`: Advisory alias (e.g., `testnet`, `betanet`, or deployment-specific labels) that clients MAY resolve to a known genesis hash.

When the authority is absent (i.e., `algorand://` is followed immediately by the resource path), clients MUST assume the canonical Algorand network implied by legacy authority-free URIs. For avoidance of doubt, the canonical network corresponds to Algorand MainNet. To preserve backward compatibility, emitters targeting that canonical network MUST omit the authority entirely. This rearrangement moves `app` and `asset` identifiers out of the authority and into the leading path segment, so resolvers that previously looked for those tokens in the authority MUST be updated.

Because authority-free URIs remain unchanged, applications that exclusively target the canonical network continue to generate and parse the exact same strings. Only resolvers and emitters that work with alternative networks need to adopt the `gh:` or `net:` authorities introduced here.

#### Client Resolution Algorithm

- If the authority begins with `gh:`, resolve to that network and validate the hash length.
- Else if the authority begins with `net:`, map the alias to a locally known genesis hash; if the alias is unknown, treat the URI as invalid.
- Else (no authority present), assume the client's configured canonical Algorand genesis hash; if such configuration is missing, treat the URI as invalid.

#### Network Selection Examples

Implicit default network:

```
algorand://asset/31566704?total
```

TestNet authoritative hash:

```
algorand://gh:<testnet_gh_b64url>/app/421337?local=bG9j
```

Private network alias:

```
algorand://net:myco-devnet/asset/31566704?total
```

Conflict example (invalid alias):

```
algorand://net:unknown-net/asset/31566704?total
```

#### Migration & Compatibility

- Parsers that expect `app` or `asset` in the authority for non-canonical networks will break. Implementations SHOULD accept legacy query-based selectors during a transition period but MUST emit the new authority-based form.
- When a legacy form is detected, apply the Option A semantics (query `gh`/`net` selectors with a canonical default) to preserve backwards compatibility.
- Authority-free canonical network URIs remain valid and identical, so tooling that only targets that network requires no changes.
- Emitters targeting the canonical network MUST omit the authority.

#### Trade-offs

- **Pros**: Encodes the network as part of the hierarchical identity, keeps the default authority-free form compact, and aligns with resolver or gateway architectures that are keyed by network.
- **Cons**: Requires ecosystem updates because the authority semantics change and the migration story is more involved than the query-based approach.

### Compliance Fragment

Implementations that emit Algorand URIs and need to declare conformance with multiple ARC MUST encode that declaration in the URI fragment using the pattern `#arc<A>+<B>+<C>...`, where every letter represents an unpadded decimal ARC number listed in strictly ascending order. Only the first entry MAY carry the `arc` literal; subsequent entries MUST be bare numbers separated by `+` and no other separators or padding are allowed. For example, `#arc26+27` is valid, while `#arc26+arc27`, `#arc026+27`, and `#arc27+26` are invalid.

Consumers of this scheme SHOULD treat fragments that do not follow this structure as non-compliant and ignore the multi-ARC declaration they attempt to convey.

### Transaction URIs

The base payment URI encoding provides a standardized way for applications and websites to express payment intent through deeplinks, QR codes, and similar transports. It is heavily based on Bitcoin's <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki">BIP-0021</a> so existing tooling can adapt with minimal changes. The optional URI authority selects the network (`gh:<hash>` or `net:<alias>`); when omitted, clients assume the canonical network.

The ABNF overview defines `paymenturn`, `paymentparams`, and `paymentparam`, which extend the shared productions with the payment-specific keys described below.

#### Query Keys

- label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)
- address: Algorand address
- xnote: A URL-encoded notes field value that must not be modifiable by the user when displayed to users.
- note: A URL-encoded default notes field value that the user interface may optionally make editable by the user.
- amount: microAlgos or smallest unit of asset
- asset: The asset id this request refers to (if Algos, simply omit this parameter)
- (others): optional, for future extensions

#### Transfer Amount and Size

!!! Note
    This is DIFFERENT than Bitcoin's BIP-0021

If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in basic unit of the asset. For example, if it's Algos (Algorand native unit), the amount MUST be specified in microAlgos. All amounts MUST NOT contain commas nor a period (.) - strictly non-negative integers.

For 100 Algos, the amount needs to be 100000000. For 54.1354 Algos the amount needs to be 54135400.

Algorand clients SHOULD display the amount in whole Algos. Where needed, microAlgos MAY be used as well. In any case, the units SHALL be clear for the user.

#### Examples

Address:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4
```

Address with label:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?label=Silvio
```

Request 150.5 Algos from an address:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?amount=150500000
```

Request 150 units of Asset ID 45 from an address:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?amount=150&asset=45
```

### Key Registration Transaction URIs

This extension to the base Algorand URI scheme defines how to encode key registration transactions so they can be shared through deeplinks, QR codes, and similar mechanisms while remaining compatible with the payment format introduced in [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md). Network selection uses the same authority-based mechanism described in the common format section.

The ABNF overview defines `keyregurn`, `keyregparams`, and `keyregparam`, which extend the shared productions with the key registration-specific keys enumerated below.

#### Scope

This section explicitly supports the two major subtypes of key registration transactions:

- Online keyreg transaction
  - Declares intent to participate in consensus and configures required keys
- Offline keyreg transaction
  - Declares intent to stop participating in consensus

The following variants of keyreg transactions are not defined:

- Non-participating keyreg transaction
  - This transaction subtype is considered deprecated
- Heartbeat keyreg transaction
  - This transaction subtype will be included in the future block incentives protocol. The protocol specifies that this transaction type must be submitted by a node in response to a programmatic "liveness challenge". It is not meant to be signed or submitted by an end user.

#### Query Keys

- address: Algorand address of transaction sender. Required.
- type: fixed to "keyreg". Used to disambiguate the transaction type from the base [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md) standard and other possible extensions. Required.
- votekeyparam: The vote key parameter to use in the transaction. Encoded with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html#section-5">base64url</a>. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- selkeyparam: The selection key parameter to use in the transaction. Encoded with base64url. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- sprfkeyparam: The state proof key parameter to use in the transaction. Encoded with base64url. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- votefstparam: The first round on which the voting keys will be valid. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- votelstparam: The last round on which the voting keys will be valid. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- votekdparam: The key dilution key parameter to use. Required for keyreg online transactions.
- xnote: As in [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md). A URL-encoded notes field value that must not be modifiable by the user when displayed to users. Optional.
- note: As in [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md). A URL-encoded default notes field value that the user interface may optionally make editable by the user. Optional.
- fee: OPTIONAL. A static fee to set for the transaction in microAlgos. Useful to signal intent to receive participation incentives (e.g. with a 2,000,000 microAlgo transaction fee.)
- (others): optional, for future extensions

#### Examples

Encoding keyreg online transaction with minimum fee:

```
{
  "txn": {
    "fee": 1000,
    "fv": 1345,
    "gh:b64": "kUt08LxeVAAGHnh4JoAoAMM9ql/hBwSoiFtlnKNeOxA=",
    "lv": 2345,
    "selkey:b64": "+lfw+Y04lTnllJfncgMjXuAePe8i8YyVeoR9c1Xi78c=",
    "snd:b64": "+gJAXOr2rkSCdPQ5DEBDLjn+iIptzLxB3oSMJdWMVyQ=",
    "sprfkey:b64": "3NoXc2sEWlvQZ7XIrwVJjgjM30ndhvwGgcqwKugk1u5W/iy/JITXrykuy0hUvAxbVv0njOgBPtGFsFif3yLJpg==",
    "type": "keyreg",
    "votefst": 1300,
    "votekd": 100,
    "votekey:b64": "UU8zLMrFVfZPnzbnL6ThAArXFsznV3TvFVAun2ONcEI=",
    "votelst": 11300
  }
}
```

Results in:

```
algorand://7IBEAXHK62XEJATU6Q4QYQCDFY475CEKNXGLYQO6QSGCLVMMK4SLVTYLMY?
type=keyreg
&selkey=-lfw-Y04lTnllJfncgMjXuAePe8i8YyVeoR9c1Xi78c
&sprfkey=3NoXc2sEWlvQZ7XIrwVJjgjM30ndhvwGgcqwKugk1u5W_iy_JITXrykuy0hUvAxbVv0njOgBPtGFsFif3yLJpg

&votekd=100
&votekey=UU8zLMrFVfZPnzbnL6ThAArXFsznV3TvFVAun2ONcEI
&votelst=11300
```

Note: newlines added for readability.

Note the difference between base64 encoding in the raw object and base64url encoding in the URI parameters. For example, the selection key parameter `selkey` that begins with `+lfw+` in the raw object is encoded in base64url to `-lfw-` in the URI.

Note: Here, the fee is omitted from the URI (due to being set to the minimum 1,000 microAlgos.) When the fee is omitted, it is left up to the application or wallet to decide. This is for demonstrative purposes; the specification does not require this behavior.

Encoding keyreg offline transaction:

```
{
  "txn": {
    "fee": 1000,
    "fv": 1776240,
    "gh:b64": "kUt08LxeVAAGHnh4JoAoAMM9ql/hBwSoiFtlnKNeOxA=",
    "lv": 1777240,
    "snd:b64": "+gJAXOr2rkSCdPQ5DEBDLjn+iIptzLxB3oSMJdWMVyQ=",
    "type": "keyreg"
  }
}
```

Results in:

```
algorand://7IBEAXHK62XEJATU6Q4QYQCDFY475CEKNXGLYQO6QSGCLVMMK4SLVTYLMY?type=keyreg
```

This offline keyreg transaction encoding is the smallest compatible representation.

Encoding keyreg online transaction with custom fee and note:

```
{
  "txn": {
    "fee": 2000000,
    "fv": 1345,
    "gh:b64": "kUt08LxeVAAGHnh4JoAoAMM9ql/hBwSoiFtlnKNeOxA=",
    "lv": 2345,

    "votelst": 11300

### Application NoOp Call URIs

NoOp calls are generic application calls that execute an Algorand smart contract's approval program. This URI extension encodes the transactions so wallets, dApps, and services can invoke specific application methods using deeplinks and QR codes while remaining consistent with [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md). As with other URI types, the optional authority selects the network.

The ABNF overview defines `noopurn`, `noopparams`, and `noopparam`, which extend the shared productions with the application call keys described below.

As in [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md), URIs follow the general format for URIs as set forth in RFC 3986. The path component consists of an Algorand address, and the query component provides additional transaction parameters.

Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range. These are encoded differently depending on their expected character set. The text components (note, xnote) MUST first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence MUST be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986. The binary components (args, refs, etc.) MUST be encoded with base64url as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html#section-5">RFC 4648 section 5</a>.

#### Query Keys

- address: Algorand address of transaction sender
- type: fixed to "appl". Used to disambiguate the transaction type from the base [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md) standard and other possible extensions
- app: The first reference is set to specify the called application (Algorand Smart Contract) ID and is mandatory. Additional references are optional and will be used in the Application NoOp call's foreign applications array.
- method: Specify the full method expression (e.g. "example_method(uint64,uint64)void").
- arg: Specify arguments used for calling the NoOp method, to be encoded within URI.
- box: Box references to be used in Application NoOp method call box array.
- asset: Asset reference to be used in Application NoOp method call foreign assets array.
- account: Account or NFD address to be used in Application NoOp method call foreign accounts array.
- fee: OPTIONAL. An optional static fee to set for the transaction in microAlgos.
- (others): optional, for future extensions

Note: If the fee is omitted, it means that Minimum Fee is preferred to be used for the transaction.

#### Template URI vs Actionable URI

If the URI is constructed so that other dApps, wallets or protocols could use it with their runtime Algorand entities of interest, then the placeholder account/app address in the URI MUST be ZeroAddress ("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY5HFKQ"). Since ZeroAddress cannot initiate any action this approach is considered non-vulnerable and secure.

#### Examples

Call `claim(uint64,uint64)byte[]` on contract 11111111 paying a fee of 10000 microAlgos from a specific address:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?type=appl&app=11111111&method=claim(uint64,uint64)byte[]&arg=20000&arg=474567&asset=45&fee=10000
```

Call the same method paying the default 1000 microAlgo fee while providing additional foreign applications:

```
algorand://TMTAD6N22HCS2LKH7677L2KFLT3PAQWY6M4JFQFXQS32ECBFC23F57RYX4?type=appl&app=11111111&method=claim(uint64,uint64)byte[]&arg=20000&arg=474567&asset=45&app=22222222&app=33333333
```

### Blockchain Query URIs

This read-only URI extension defines a standardized method for querying application and asset data on Algorand. It enables applications, websites, and QR code implementations to construct URIs that retrieve application state, box data, and asset metadata in a structured format. The design is inspired by [ARC-26](./arc-0026.md) and reuses its core URI principles for consistency.

Algorand URIs in this section follow the general format for URIs as defined in RFC 3986. The authority optionally selects the network (`gh:<hash>` or `net:<alias>`), while the leading path segment specifies whether the URI targets an application (`.../app/<id>`) or an asset (`.../asset/<id>`). Query parameters define the specific data fields being requested. Parameters MAY contain characters outside the valid range. These MUST first be encoded in UTF-8, then percent-encoded according to RFC 3986.

The ABNF overview defines `appqueryurn`, `appqueryparam`, `assetqueryurn`, and `assetqueryparam`, which extend the shared productions with the query keys summarized below.

#### Application Query URIs (`algorand://app`)

The application URI allows querying the state of an application, including data from the application's box storage, global storage, and local storage, as well as the TEAL program associated with it. Each storage type has specific requirements.

#### Asset Query URIs (`algorand://asset`)

The asset URI enables retrieval of metadata and configuration details for a specific asset, such as its name, total supply, decimal precision, and associated addresses.

#### Parameter Definitions

**Application parameters**

- `box`: Queries the application's box storage with a key encoded in base64url.
- `global`: Queries the global storage of the application using a base64url-encoded key.
- `local`: Queries local storage for a specified account. Requires an additional `algorandaddress` parameter, representing the account whose local storage is queried.
- `algorandaddress`: Supplies the account whose local storage should be inspected when paired with `local`.
- `tealcode`: Requests the TEAL program associated with the application.

**Asset parameters**

- `total`: Queries the total supply of the asset.
- `decimals`: Queries the number of decimal places used for the asset.
- `frozen`: Queries whether the asset is frozen by default.
- `unitname`: Queries the short name or unit symbol of the asset (e.g., "USDT").
- `assetname`: Queries the full name of the asset (e.g., "Tether").
- `url`: Queries the URL associated with the asset, providing more information.
- `metadatahash`: Queries the metadata hash associated with the asset.
- `manager`: Queries the address of the asset manager.
- `reserve`: Queries the reserve address holding non-minted units of the asset.
- `freeze`: Queries the freeze address for the asset.
- `clawback`: Queries the clawback address for the asset.

#### Query Key Descriptions

For each parameter, the query key name is listed, followed by its purpose:

- `box`: Retrieves information from the specified box storage key.
- `global`: Retrieves data from the specified global storage key.
- `local`: Retrieves data from the specified local storage key. Requires `algorandaddress` to specify the account.
- `total`: Retrieves the asset's total supply.
- `decimals`: Retrieves the number of decimal places for the asset.
- `frozen`: Retrieves the default frozen status of the asset.
- `unitname`: Retrieves the asset's short name or symbol.
- `assetname`: Retrieves the full name of the asset.
- `url`: Retrieves the URL associated with the asset.
- `metadatahash`: Retrieves the metadata hash for the asset.
- `manager`: Retrieves the manager address of the asset.
- `reserve`: Retrieves the reserve address for the asset.
- `freeze`: Retrieves the freeze address of the asset.
- `clawback`: Retrieves the clawback address of the asset.

#### Examples

Query an application's box storage:

```
algorand://app/2345?box=YWxnb3JvbmQ=
```

Query global storage:

```
algorand://app/12345?global=Z2xvYmFsX2tleQ==
```

Query local storage for a specific address:

```
algorand://app/12345?local=bG9jYWxfa2V5&algorandaddress=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
```

Query the total supply of an asset:

```
algorand://asset/67890?total
```

## Rationale

The present aims to provide a standardized way to encode key registration transactions in order to enhance the user experience of signing key registration transactions in general, and in particular in the use case of an Algorand node runner that does not have their spending keys resident on their node (as is best practice). The parameter names were chosen to match the corresponding names in encoded key registration transactions.

Algorand application NoOp method calls cover the majority of application transactions in Algorand and have a wide range of use-cases. For use-cases where the runtime knows exactly what the called application needs in terms of arguments and transaction arrays and there are no direct interactions, this extension is required since the original ARC-26 standard did not support application calls.

Previously, the Algorand URI scheme was primarily used to create transactions on the chain. Extending it to cover read-only queries allows a URI scheme to directly retrieve information from the chain, specifically for applications and assets. This provides a unified, standardized method for querying Algorand application and asset data, allowing interoperability across applications and services.

## Backwards Compatibility

This ARC replaces ARCs 26, 78, 79, and 82 without invalidating previously generated URIs. Existing URIs that conform to the earlier specifications remain valid under this consolidated definition, so no backwards incompatibilities are introduced beyond the deprecation of the superseded documents. For network selection, implementations MAY continue to accept the legacy query-based selectors during a migration period but SHOULD emit the authority-based form specified above.

## Reference Implementation

None.

## Security Considerations

The transaction-related sections of this specification introduce no additional security considerations beyond those identified in the originating ARCs.

Since the blockchain query URIs are intended for read-only operations, they do not alter application or asset state, mitigating many security risks. However, data retrieved from these URIs should be validated to ensure it meets user expectations and that any displayed data cannot be tampered with.
