## Abstract
According to [ARC-0004](./arc-0004.md), all dynamic arrays must be prefixed with their element length encoded as a uint16. This information is not necessary when the element type is static and thus it should be removed for simplicity sake. The exception is if the array is encoded inside of a tuple.

## Motivation
ABI-compliant contracts freuquently work with `string` types but all of the AVM opcodes expect regular byteslices, wihch means extra opcodes are needed when using a `string` with opcodes, which is quite common.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

If encoding a dynamic array, `x`, of type `T[]`, and the element type `T` is static, the array is encoded by simply concatenating all values of `x` together. If the array is inside of a tuple or array, the number of elements in `x` must be encoded as `uint16` and prefixed to the array, as per [ARC-0004](./arc-0004.md).

## Rationale
This will reduce the amount of bytes required when encoding dynamic arrays and make it easier to work with `byte[]` and `string` types in the AVM.

## Backwards Compatibility
This change is not backwards compatible with [ARC-0004](./arc-0004.md).

## Test Cases
N/A

## Reference Implementation
`[1, 2, 3]` encoded as `uint8[]`

[ARC-0004](./arc-0004.md): `0x 0003 01 02 03`

This ARC:  `0x 01 02 03`

## Security Considerations
None
