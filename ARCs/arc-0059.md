## Abstract

The goal of this standard is to establish a standard in the Algorand ecosystem by which ASAs can be sent to an intended receiver even if their account is not opted in to the ASA.

A wallet custodied by an application will be used to custody assets on behalf of a given user, with only that user being able to withdraw assets. A master application will be used to map inbox addresses to user address. This master application can route ASAs to users performing whatever actions are necessary.

If integrated into ecosystem technologies including wallets, explorers, and dApps, this standard can provide enhanced capabilities around ASAs which are otherwise strictly bound at the protocol level to require opting in to be received.

## Motivation

Algorand requires accounts to opt in to receive any ASA, a fact which simultaneously:

1. Grants account holders fine-grained control over their holdings by allowing them to select which assets to allow and preventing receipt of unwanted tokens.
2. Frustrates users and developers when accounting for this requirement especially since other blockchains do not have this requirement.

This ARC lays out a new way to navigate the ASA opt in requirement.

### Contemplated Use Cases

The following use cases help explain how this capability can enhance the possibilities within the Algorand ecosystem.

#### Airdrops

An ASA creator who wants to send their asset to a set of accounts faces the challenge of needing their intended receivers to opt in to the ASA ahead of time, which requires non-trivial communication efforts and precludes the possibility of completing the airdrop as a surprise. This claimable ASA standard creates the ability to send an airdrop out to individual addresses so that the receivers can opt in and claim the asset at their convenience--or not, if they so choose.

#### Reducing New User On-boarding Friction

An application operator who wants to on-board users to their game or business may want to reduce the friction of getting people started by decoupling their application on-boarding process from the process of funding a non-custodial Algorand wallet, if users are wholly new to the Algorand ecosystem. As long as the receiver's address is known, an ASA can be sent to them ahead of them having ALGOs in their wallet to cover the minimum balance requirement and opt in to the asset.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### Sending an Asset

When sending an asset, the sender **SHOULD** call `ARC59_getSendAssetInfo` to determine relevant information about the receiver and the router. This information is included as a tuple described below

| Index | Object Property            | Description                                                                      | Type   |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 0     | itxns                      | The number of itxns required                                                     | uint64 |
| 1     | mbr                        | The amount of ALGO the sender **MUST** send the the router contract to cover MBR | uint64 |
| 2     | routerOptedIn              | Whether the router is already opted in to the asset                              | bool   |
| 3     | receiverOptedIn            | Whether the receiver is already directly opted in to the asset                   | bool   |
| 4     | receiverAlgoNeededForClaim | The amount of ALGO the receiver would currently need to claim the asset          | uint64 |

This information can then be used to send the asset. An example of using this information to send an asset is shown in [the reference implementation section](#typescript-send-asset-function).

### Claiming an Asset

When claiming an asset, the claimer **MUST** call `arc9_claim` to claim the asset from their inbox. This will transfer the asset to the claimer and any extra ALGO in the inbox will be sent to the claimer.

Prior to sending the `arc59_claim` app call, a call to `arc59_claimAlgo` **SHOULD** be made to claim any extra ALGO in the inbox if the inbox balance is above its minimum balance.

An example of claiming an asset is shown in [the reference implementation section](#typescript-claim-function).

## Rationale

This design was created to offer a standard mechanism by which wallets, explorers, and dapps could enable users to send, receive, and find claimable ASAs without requiring any changes to the core protocol.

This ARC is intended to replace [ARC-12](./arc-0012.md). This ARC is simpler than [ARC-12](./arc-0012.md), with the main feature lost being senders not getting back MBR. Given the significant reduction in complexity it is considered to be worth the tradeoff. No way to get back MBR is also another way to disincentivize spam.

### Rejection

The initial proposal for this ARC included a method for burning that leveraged [ARC-54](./arc-0054.md). After further consideration though it was decided to remove the burn functionality with a reject method. The reject method does not burn the ASA. It simply closes out to the creator. This decision was made to reduce the additional complexity and potential user friction that [ARC-54](./arc-0054.md) opt-ins introduced.

### Router MBR

It should be noted that the MBR for the router contract itself is non-recoverable. This was an intentional decision that results in more predictable costs for assets that may freuqently be sent through the router, such as stablecoins.

## Test Cases

Test cases for the JavaScript client and the [ARC-59](./arc-0059.md) smart contract implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/tree/main/assets/arc-0059/__test__/">here</a>

## Reference Implementation

### TypeScript Claim Function

```ts
/**
 * Claim an asset from the ARC59 inbox
 *
 * @param appClient The ARC59 client generated by algokit
 * @param assetId The ID of the asset to claim
 * @param claimer The address of the account claiming the asset
 * @param algorand The AlgorandClient instance to use to send transactions
 */
async function arc59Claim(
  appClient: Arc59Client,
  assetId: bigint,
  claimer: string,
  algorand: algokit.AlgorandClient
) {
  const composer = appClient.compose();

  // Check if the claimer has opted in to the asset
  let claimerOptedIn = false;
  try {
    await algorand.account.getAssetInformation(claimer, assetId);
    claimerOptedIn = true;
  } catch (e) {
    // Do nothing
  }

  const inbox = (
    await appClient
      .compose()
      .arc59GetInbox({ receiver: claimer })
      .simulate({ allowUnnamedResources: true })
  ).returns[0];

  let totalTxns = 3;

  // If the inbox has extra ALGO, claim it
  const inboxInfo = await algorand.account.getInformation(inbox);
  if (inboxInfo.minBalance < inboxInfo.amount) {
    totalTxns += 2;
    composer.arc59ClaimAlgo(
      {},
      {
        sender: algorand.account.getAccount(claimer),
        sendParams: { fee: algokit.algos(0) },
      }
    );
  }

  // If the claimer hasn't already opted in, add a transaction to do so
  if (!claimerOptedIn) {
    composer.addTransaction({
      txn: await algorand.transactions.assetOptIn({ assetId, sender: claimer }),
      signer: algorand.account.getSigner(claimer),
    });
  }

  composer.arc59Claim(
    { asa: assetId },
    {
      sender: algorand.account.getAccount(claimer),
      sendParams: { fee: algokit.microAlgos(1000 * totalTxns) },
    }
  );

  await composer.execute();
}
```

## Security Considerations

The router application controls all user inboxes. If this contract is compromised, user assets might also be compromised.
