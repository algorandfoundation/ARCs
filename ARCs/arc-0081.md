## Abstract

This ARC proposes a hashing identifier for checking the integrity of a set of consensus participation keys

## Motivation

Participation key material can be inadvertently mutated between their generation on a participating node and the wallet where the key registration transaction is signed. Currently, the only way for a node runner to be diligent about signing key registration transactions is to individually verify 176 base64 characters across 3 key fields, as well as the 3 numeric fields for validity and key dillution.

An online keyreg transaction with incorrect partkey material can succeed, which would render the participating account silently delinquent: their registered participation keys would not correspond to the actual keypairs on the node.

The integrity hash aims to be a short, human readable identifier that hashes all relevant participation key material, which node runners can reference at a glance in order to verify the integrity of the participation keys between their node, wallet or later on an explorer.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

The integrity hash is a shortened version of a SHA512_256 hash of the concatenated part key material, represented in base32 encoding:

`base32_nopad(substr(sha512_256(concat_key_material), 0, 8))`

- `concat_key_material` uniquely identifies the participation key
    - it is a concatenation of the following values:
        - account address (raw encoding, length: 32 bytes)
        - selection key (raw encoding, length: 32 bytes)
        - vote key (raw encoding, length: 32 bytes)
        - state proof key (raw encoding, length: 32 bytes)
        - first valid voting round (encoded as uint64, length: 8 bytes)
            - Note: this MUST NOT be omitted. When the first valid voting round is zero, an explicit uint64 zero value is expected.
            - Implementation warning: this field can be missing in msgpack encoded keyreg transactions due to the `omitempty` behavior.
        - last valid voting round (encoded as uint64, length: 8 bytes)
        - key dillution (encoded as uint64, length: 8 bytes)
    - its length MUST be exactly 184 bytes
- `sha512_256` refers to the SHA512_256 hashing function
- `subsstr(x, 0, 8)` refers to the "substring" function, i.e. returning the first 8 bytes of value `x`
- `base32_nopad` refers to the RFC 4648 base32 encoding function, but omitting the padding suffix characters (`=`)
