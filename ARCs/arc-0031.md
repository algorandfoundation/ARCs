# Authentication with Algorand accounts

A standard for authentication with Algorand accounts.

## Abstract

This ARC introduces a standard for authenticating users with their Algorand accounts. It leverages asymmetric encryption <*PK, SK*> to verify the identity of a user, owner of an Algorand account. This approach fosters the adoption of novel identity management systems for both Web3 and Web2 applications.

### Definitions

- **System**: any frontend/backend application, service provider, or in general an entity not based on blockchain;
- **Credentials**: any type of authentication used by users to access their online accounts, e.g. username/password, PIN, public/secret key pair;
- **Blockchain identity**: a public/secret key pair <*PK, SK*> representing a blockchain account;
- **Algorand account**: a blockchain identity on Algorand identified with the key pair <*PKa, SKa*>;
- **Algorand address**: the public key *PKa* of an Algorand account;
- **User**: an Algorand account holder;
- **Verifier**: a system that needs to verify the identity of a User;
- **dApp**: a decentralized Algorand application that natively runs on the Algorand blockchain, aka "*smart contract*";
- **Wallet**: an off-chain application that stores the secret keys *SKa*s of Algorand accounts and can display and sign transactions for these accounts;
- **message**: a generic string of bytes;
- **digital signature**: a message signed with the private key of a blockchain identity.

## Motivation

In Web3 users interacting with dApps must be authenticated with a blockchain identity (account for Algorand). Having dApps and traditional Web2 systems increasingly more interconnected, it is not difficult to imagine users consuming services both from a dApp and a Web2 application simultaneously. In this case, a single source of authentication should be used to avoid separation between credentials used for dApps and traditional Web2 services.

This ARC provides a standard for users' authentication in Web2 services leveraging Algorand accounts.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>
> Comments like this are non-normative.

Interfaces are defined in TypeScript. All the objects that are defined are valid JSON objects, and all JSON string types are UTF-8 encoded.

This ARC uses interchangeably the terms "*blockchain address*", "*public key*", and "*PK*" to indicate the on-chain address of a blockchain identity, and in particular of an Algorand account.

### Overview

This document describes a standard approach to authenticate a User with a blockchain identity. Algorand addresses are used as a *unique identifiers*, and the secret keys to digitally sign *messages* as a proof of identity.

To sum up, given an Algorand account <*PKa, SKa*>, this ARC defines a standards for:

- creating an [ARC-31](./arc-0031.md) compliant digital signature with *SKa*;
- verifying an [ARC-31](./arc-0031.md) compliant digital signature with *PKa*.

### Assumptions

The standard proposed in this document works under the following assumptions:

- User and Verifier communicate over secure SSL/TLS encrypted channels;
- The Verifier knows the Usersâ€™ *PKa*;
- For each *PKa* the Verifier generates a unique message to be signed;
- The message MUST change arbitrarily for each authentication request to avoid [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack);
- User's secret key is safely kept into a Wallet;
- Users do not change their public address *PKa* for authentication;
- Users **MUST** use Algorand compliant keys to sign the messages;
- LogicSigs and Application addresses are not supported;

### Authentication Mechanism

The authentication mechanism defined in this ARC works as follows: a Users sends an authentication request to the Verifier specifying the Algorand account <*PKa, SKa*>.

> Note that Algorand transforms traditional 32-bytes cryptographic keys into more readable and user-friendly objects. A detailed description of such a transformation can be found on the <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/#keys-and-addresses">developer portal</a>.

The Verifier responds with a message to be signed with the account's secret key *SKa*. The User queries the Wallet to sign the message. At that stage, the Wallet **MUST** check the message origin with the expected Verifier (to protect Users from [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)). Once the message is signed, the User sends the result back to the Verifier. Finally, the Verifier checks the signature and, if it is all good, authenticates the User.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Alice
    participant W as Wallet
    actor B as Bob
    A-->>W: Connect to Bob with PKa
    activate W
    W->>B: GET message for PKa
    activate B
    B->>B: Create a new msg for PKa
    B->>W: msg
    deactivate B
    W->>W: Check <msg, Bob>
    W-->>A: Show msg origin
    Note right of A: Confirm signature
    A-->>W: 
    W->>B: <PKa, Sig(msg)>
    deactivate W
    activate B
    B->>B: Verify Sig(msg) with PKa and msg
    Note right of B: if Sig(msg) is valid<br/>then authenticate user
    B-->>A: Authentication OK/KO
    deactivate B
```

The diagram above summarizes the proposed mechanism. We consider the User, **Alice**, owner of an Algorand account <*PKa, SKa*> of which the secret key *SKa* is stored into a **Wallet**.

> A wallet is any type of Algorand wallet, such as hot wallets like <a href="https://www.purestake.com/technology/algosigner/">AlgoSigner</a>, <a href="https://wallet.myalgo.com/">MyAlgo Wallet</a> for browser and mobile wallets used through <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/walletconnect/">WalletConnect</a>, and cold wallets like the <a href="https://www.ledger.com">Ledger Nano</a>.

Alice authenticates herself to the Verifier **Bob** sending back the digital signature `Sig(msg)` of message `msg` provided by Bob. The mechanism proceeds as follows:

1. Alice initiates an authentication with *PKa* to Bob;
2. Bob generates a message `msg` to be signed by Alice's *SKa*;
3. Alice signs `msg` using her wallet; the Wallet inspects and displays the `msg` origin to be sure it came from Bob;
4. Alice sends back the tuple `<PKa, Sig(msg)>` to Bob;
5. Bob verifies `Sig(msg)` with Alice's *PKa* and `msg`;
6. If the signature is valid, Bob authenticates Alice.

The ARC-31 defines a standardized message for authentication, called *Authentication Message*.

### Authentication Message

An *Authentication Message* `auth-msg` is a sequence of bytes representing a message to be signed. The Verifier requests Users to sign an `auth-msg` with their secret keys. Such a message **MUST** include the following information:

- `domain name`: name of the Verifier domain;
- `Algorand address`: User's *PKa* to be authenticated;
- `nonce`: a unique/random value generated by the Verifier;
- `description`: Verifier details or general description;
- `metadata`: arbitrary message data.

The *Authentication Message* is represented with the following interface:

```typescript
interface AuthMessage {
 /** The domain name of the Verifier */
 domain: string;
 /** Algorand account to authenticate with*/
 authAcc: string;
 /** Unique random nonce generated by the Verifier */
 nonce: string;
 /** Optional, description of the Verifier */
 desc?: string;
 /** Optional, metadata */
 meta?: string;
}
```

The `auth-msg` **SHOULD** be compliant with [ARC-2](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0002.md), having the parameter `\<dapp-name\>`=`arc31`, for example:

```json
arc31:j{
 "domain": "www.verifierdomain.com",
 "authAcc": "KTGP47G64KCXWJS64W7SGJNKTHE37TYDCI64USXI3XOYE6ZSH4LCI7NIDA",
 "nonce": "1234abcde!%",
 "desc": "The Verifier",
 "meta": "arbitrary attached data",
}
```

The `nonce` field **MUST** be unique for each authentication and **MUST NOT** be used more than once to avoid replay attacks.

#### Signing the Authentication Message

The `auth-msg` **MUST** be exchanged as a base64 encoded [msgpacked](https://msgpack.org/index.html) message, prefixed with the `"AX"` domain separator, such that: 

`msg =("AX" + msgpack_encode(auth-msg))`.

### Authenticate Rekeyed Accounts

Algorand accounts can be rekeyed. Rekeying means that the signing key of a static public address *PKa* is dynamically rotated to another secret key. In this case, the original address controlled by *SKa'* is called *authorization address* of *PKa*, and it **MUST** be used to check the signature of *PKa*. In this ARC we indicate the *authorization address* with the account *<PKa', SKa'>*.

> To learn more about Algorand Rekeying feature visit the [Rekey section](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/rekey/?from_query=rekey#create-publication-overlay) of the developer portal.

The *authorization address* of an account can be checked directly from the Algorand blockchain. Indeed, a Verifier can inspect the [account API](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/algod/v2/#get-v2accountsaddress) to check the account's `auth-addr` parameter. This parameter, if not empty, indicates the *authorization address* *PKa'*.

The ARC-31 allows rekeyed accounts to be used for authentication. In this case, the Verifier must check the signature of a *PKa* with the *authorization address* *PKa'*. This address must be provided by the User along with the original address *PKa* and the digital signature. The Verifier, on his side, can check the validity of *PKa'* by looking at the Algorand blockchain. The diagram below details the protocol handling rekeyed accounts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Alice
    participant W as Wallet
    actor B as Bob
    participant Algorand
    A-->>W: Connect to Bob with PKa
    activate W
    W->>B: GET message for PKa
    activate B
    B->>B: Create a new msg for PKa
    B->>W: msg
    deactivate B
    W->>W: Check <msg, Bob>
    W-->>A: Show msg origin
    Note right of A: Confirm signature with <br/>auth-addr <PKa', SKa'>
    A-->>W: 
    W->>B: <PKa, PKa', Sig(msg)>
    deactivate W
    activate B
    B->>Algorand: Retrieve PKa auth-addr
    activate Algorand
    Algorand-->>B: PKa'
    deactivate Algorand
    B->>B: Verify PKa auth-addr
    B->>B: Verify Sig(msg) with PKa' and msg
    Note right of B: if Sig(msg) is valid<br/>then authenticate user
    B-->>A: Authentication OK/KO
    deactivate B
```

### Authenticate Multisignature Accounts

Algorand accounts can be Multisignature (or MultiSig). A MultiSig account is a logical representation of an ordered set of addresses with a threshold and version.

> To learn more about Algorand MultiSig feature visit the [Multisignature section](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/create/#multisignature) of the developer portal.

The ARC-31 allows MultiSig accounts to be used for authentication. Assuming a MultiSig address *PKa_msig* composed by three Algorand accounts identified with the addresses *PKa', PKa'', PKa'''*, `threshold=2`, and `version=1`, the authentication should work as follows:

1. An authentication request with *PKa_msig* is sent from the User to the Verifier;
2. The Verifier responds with a new authentication message `msg`;
3. The User collects the threshold signatures of `msg` and responds with *<PKa_msig, PKa', PKa'', PKa''', Sig'(msg), Sig''(msg), 2, 1>*, where *PKa*s are the ordered set of addresses of *PKa_msig*, *Sig*s are the collected signatures, `2` is the threshold and `1` is the MultiSig version;
4. The Verifier firstly checks the *PKa_msig* against the list of addresses, the threshold and the version received, then verifies the signatures; if a threshold of valid signatures is received, the User can be authenticated.

The diagram below details the protocol handling MultiSig accounts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Alice
    participant W as Wallet
    actor B as Bob
    A-->>W: Connect to Bob with PKa_msig
    activate W
    W->>B: GET message for PKa_msig
    activate B
    B->>B: Create a new msg for PKa_msig
    B->>W: msg
    deactivate B
    W->>W: Check <msg, Bob>
    W-->>A: Show msg origin
    Note right of A: Collect signatures with <br/>PKa' and PKa''
    A-->>W: 
    W->>B: <PKa_msig, PKa', PKa'', PKa''', Sig'(msg), Sig''(msg), 2, 1>
    deactivate W
    activate B
    B->>B: Verify PKa_msig with (PKa', PKa'', PKa''', 2, 1)
    B->>B: Verify Sig'(msg) with PKa' and msg
    B->>B: Verify Sig''(msg) with PKa'' and msg
    Note right of B: if threshold of valid signatures<br/>then authenticate user
    B-->>A: Authentication OK/KO
    deactivate B
```

### How to verify a digital signature?

A digital signature generated with the secret key *SKa* of an Algorand account can be verified with its respective 32-byte public key *PKa*. The Verifier needs to decode the public key *PK* from the Algorand address, and it must know the original `auth-msg`. For example, assuming the digital signature `Sig(msg)` the Verifier can validate it using the Algorand SDK as follows:

1. decode the Algorand address into a traditional 32-bytes public key *PK*;
2. Compute `msg =("AX" + msgpack_encode(auth-msg))`;
3. use an open-source cryptographic library (e.g. Python lib PyNaCl) to verify the signature `Sig(msg)` with *PK*.

## Security Considerations

An attacker **MAY** attempt to cheat with the system by impersonating another User or Verifier. This is possible if the attacker can intercept the digital signature and use the same signature in a replay-attack or man-in-the-middle attack. To mitigate this scenario, the Verifier **MUST** generate a new message for each authentication request, and Wallets must always check the `auth-msg` domain field.

## Reference Implementation

The ARC-31 reference implementation is available in the `assets` directory of this repo `assets/arc-0031`. It provides an example of client-server authentication with ARC-31. The reference implementation uses [MyAlgoWallet](https://wallet.myalgo.com/) as the unique wallet (at the time of writing) providing the possibility of signing random bytes.
