## Abstract

This ARC defines the interface and the implementation of a singleton Application
that provides Algorand Standard Assets metadata through the Algod API.

## Motivation

Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) lack a dedicated metadata field on the Algorand ledger
for storing additional asset information.

Although it's generally not advisable to use Algorand as a distributed storage system
for data that could easily reside elsewhere, the absence of a native metadata store
on the ledger has led the ecosystem to adopt less-than-ideal solutions for discovering
and fetching off-chain asset data, involving the usage of an Indexer or external
infrastructure (such as IPFS), or hacking on the ASA RBAC roles to get asset metadata
mutability.

While storing huge data, such as images, off-chain is a practical (and recommended)
approach, smaller, more pertinent data should not incur the expenses, availability
challenges, and latency typically associated with external infrastructure.

This ARC establishes a standardized URI within the ASA URL field to solve this simple
use case: _directly retrieving ASA metadata using the Algod API_.

## Specification

The keywords "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**",
"**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

> Notes like this are non-normative.

### ASA Metadata Registry

The ASA Metadata Registry is an _immutable singleton_ Application that stores _mutable_
or _immutable_ Asset Metadata.

#### ASA Metadata Box

The Asset Metadata are stored in a dedicated Box, called _Asset Metadata Box_.

The Asset Metadata Box Name **MUST** be equal to the _Asset ID_ (`uint64`).

The Asset Metadata **MUST** fit into a single Box.

> Refer to the [AppSpec section](#appspec) for the detailed [ARC-56](./arc-0056.md)
> Application Specification of the singleton reference implementation.

##### Create Metadata

To create the Asset Metadata:

- The ASA **MUST** _exist_, and

- The Asset URL (`au`) **MUST** conform to this specification (see the [Asset URL
section](#asset-url)), and

- The authorization **MUST** be restricted to the Asset Manager.

The Asset Metadata **MAY** be set as _immutable_.

The Asset Metadata **MUST** be stored as value of a new Asset Metadata Box.

The MBR of the created Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be provided contextually.

##### Update Metadata

To update the Asset Metadata:

- The ASA **MUST** still _exist_, and

- The Asset Metadata **MUST NOT** be _immutable_, and

- The authorization **MUST** be restricted to the Asset Manager.

The updated Asset Metadata **MUST** replace the value of the existing Asset Metadata
Box.

The MBR of the updated Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be managed contextually:

- If the Asset Metadata Box size is increased, the additional MBR **MUST** be provided;

- If the Asset Metadata Box size is decreased, the freed-up MBR **MUST** be returned
to the Asset Manager.

##### Delete Metadata

To delete the Asset Metadata:

- If the ASA still _exists_:

  - The Asset Metadata **MUST NOT** _immutable_, and 

  - The authorization **MUST** be restricted to the Asset Manager.

- If the ASA has been _destroyed_:

  - The authorization **MUST NOT** be restricted.

> Not even the Asset Manager can delete the _immutable_ Asset Metadata of an _existing_
> ASA, while anyone can delete Asset Metadata if the ASA has been _destroyed_, regardless
> of being _immutable_ or not.

The Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be deleted.

The MBR of the deleted Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be managed contextually:

- If the ASA _exists_, it **MUST** be returned to the Asset Manager, otherwise

- It **MUST** be split among the caller (10%) and the Fee Sink (90%).

### Asset URL

The _Asset URL_ (`au`) field is used as a _partial_ URI pointing to the Asset Metadata
on the Algorand ledger.

The _Asset URL_ (`au`) **MUST** be the _partial_ [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) URI:

`algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=`

Refer to the [Asset Metadata URI section](#asset-metadata-uri) for details about
the _complete_ [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) _Asset Metadata URI_.

### [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) Compliance

The compliance with [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) is **OPTIONAL** but **RECOMMENDED**.

If the ASA conforms to [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md), then:

- The ASA **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3 ASA Parameters Conventions_](./arc-0003.md#asa-parameters-conventions)
for the _Asset Name_ (`an`) and the _Asset URL_ (`au`) fields.

  - It is **RECOMMENDED** to use the `#arc3` _Asset URL_ (`au`) suffix option, so
  the _partial_ [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) URI would be: `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=#arc3`

- If the Asset Metadata are _immutable_, the ASA **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3
ASA Parameters Conventions_](./arc-0003.md#asa-parameters-conventions) for the _Asset
Metadata Hash_ (`an`) field.

- The Asset Metadata **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3 JSON Metadata File Schema_](./arc-0003.md#json-metadata-file-schema).

Refer to the [Asset Metadata URI section](#asset-metadata-uri) for details about
the _complete_ [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) _Asset Metadata URI_.

### Asset Metadata URI

To get the [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) _Asset Metadata URI_, clients **SHALL** complete
the _Asset URL_ with the `boxparam` filled with the Asset Metadata Box Name, equal
to the _Asset ID_ (encoded as `base64url`):

`algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=<base64url_encoded_asset_id>`

#### Examples

> The _Asset Metadata URI_ for the ASA `12345` would be:
>
> `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=MDk=`
>
> The _Asset Metadata URI_ for the [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) ASA
> `12345` would be:
>
> `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=MDk=#arc3`

## Rationale

The _singleton_ ASA Metadata Registry Application and the standard [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md)
_Asset Metadata URI_ are a simple and efficient way to provide _mutable_ and _immutable_
Asset Metadata to the clients directly through the <a href="https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/">Algod API</a>,
without the need of an additional infrastructure.

The Asset Metadata size is limited on purpose to a single Box. This is a reasonable
trade-off between simplicity (avoiding Box chaining), data size (at most 32kB), and
Algod efficiency (discouraging the usage of Algorand as a distributed storage system).
Additional large metadata related to the ASA (such as images) can still be referenced
in the Asset Metadata, stored in the Box, through their external URI (e.g., `ipfs://...`
or `https://...`).

The standard supports two different entrypoints for the Asset Metadata discovery
and retrieval: the _Asset ID_ (available on the Algorand ledger) or the _Asset Metadata
URI_ (which could be distributed on the Web or by other external channels).

> Refer to the [Usage section](#usage) for details.

The compliance with [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) ensures interoperability with existing
infrastructures, such as explorers and wallets, and other applications.

The deletion of (abandoned) Asset Metadata related to destroyed ASAs is incentivized
by returning a small fraction (10%) of the Asset Metadata Box MBR to the caller,
while the remainder (90%) is donated to the Fee Sink.

## Backwards Compatibility

Backwards compatibility for existing ASA is not possible, since the _Asset URL_ (`au`)
field is immutable.

## Reference Implementation

TBD

### AppSpec

TBD

### Usage

The clients use the Algod API to retrieve the Asset Metadata from two entrypoints:

1. The _Asset ID_;

1. The _Asset Metadata URI_.

> A minimal [Python SDK]() is provided with the reference implementation.

#### Example 1: Get [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) Metadata from the Asset ID

Given the _Asset ID_ `12345`, the client:

1. Calls the Algod API <a href="https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/#getassetbyid">GetAssetByID</a>
endpoint to get the _Asset URL_ field (`url`) from the response and drops the `#arc3`
suffix (if present), obtaining:

    `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=`;

1. Encodes the _Asset ID_ as `base64url` to get the Asset Metadata Box Name (`<base64url_encoded_asset_id>`);

1. Calls the Algod API <a href="https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/#getapplicationboxbyname">GetApplicationBoxByName</a>
endpoint to get the content of the _Asset Metadata Box_ from the response:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost/v2/applications/<singleton_arc89_app_id>/box?name=<base64_encoded_asset_id> \
 -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -H 'X-Algo-API-Token: API_KEY'
```

The `value` field of the response contains the Asset [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) JSON
Metadata.

#### Example 2: Get [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) Metadata from Asset Metadata URI

Given the _Asset Metadata URI_ `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=<base64_encoded_asset_id>#arc3`,
the client:

1. Calls the Algod API <a href="https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/#getapplicationboxbyname">GetApplicationBoxByName</a>
endpoint to get the content of the _Asset Metadata Box_ from the response:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost/v2/applications/<singleton_arc89_app_id>/box?name=<base64_encoded_asset_id> \
 -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -H 'X-Algo-API-Token: API_KEY'
```

The `value` field of the response contains the Asset [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) JSON
Metadata.

## Security Considerations

The authorization to create the Asset Metadata and update and delete _mutable_ Asset
Metadata is granted to the Asset Manager to preserve the ASA trust model. The authorization
is not granted to the Asset Creator, since this role could be performed programmatically
by Applications and is not supposed to be the long-lasting maintainer of the ASA.
