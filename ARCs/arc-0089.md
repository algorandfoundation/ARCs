## Abstract

This ARC defines the interface and the implementation of a singleton Application
that provides Algorand Standard Assets metadata through the Algod API.

## Motivation

Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) lack a dedicated metadata field on the Algorand ledger
for storing additional asset information.

Although it's generally not advisable to use Algorand as a distributed storage system
for data that could easily reside elsewhere, the absence of a native metadata store
on the ledger has led the ecosystem to adopt less-than-ideal solutions for discovering
and fetching off-chain asset data, involving the usage of an Indexer or external
infrastructure (such as IPFS), or hacking on the ASA RBAC roles to get asset metadata
mutability.

While storing huge data, such as images, off-chain is a practical (and recommended)
approach, smaller, more pertinent data should not incur the expenses, availability
challenges, and latency typically associated with external infrastructure.

This ARC establishes a standardized URI within the ASA URL field to solve this simple
use case: _directly retrieving ASA metadata using the Algod API_.

## Specification

The keywords "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**",
"**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

> Notes like this are non-normative.

### ASA Metadata Registry

The ASA Metadata Registry is an _immutable singleton Application_ that stores Asset
Metadata.

#### ASA Metadata Box

The Asset Metadata are stored in a dedicated Box, called _Asset Metadata Box_.

The Asset Metadata Box Name **MUST** be equal to the _Asset ID_ (`uint64`).

The Asset Metadata **MUST** fit into a single Box.

#### [ARC-56](./arc-0056.md) AppSpec

- `arc89_upload_metadata(asset_id:	unit64, ...tbd)`
- `arc89_delete_metadata(asset_id:	unit64, ...tbd)`
- `...`

##### Upload Metadata

The authorization to upload (and update) the Asset Metadata **MUST** be restricted
to the Asset Manager.

The Asset URL (`au`) **MUST** conform to this specification (see the [Asset URL section](#asset-url)).

The MBR for the Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be provided upon the Asset Metadata upload
(and update).

The Asset Metadata **MUST** be stored as the Asset Metadata Box Value.

##### Delete Metadata

The authorization to delete the Asset Metadata:

- **MUST** be restricted to the Asset Manager if the ASA exists;

- **MUST NOT** be restricted otherwise.

The MBR of the Asset Metadata Box:

- **MUST** be returned to the Asset Manager if the ASA exists;

- **MUST** be returned to the Fee Sink otherwise.

The Asset Metadata Box **MUST** be deleted.

### Asset URL

The _Asset URL_ (`au`) field is used as a URI pointing to the Asset Metadata on the
Algorand ledger.

The _Asset URL_ (`au`) **MUST** be the (partial) [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) URI:

`algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=`

The clients **SHALL** interpret the (complete) [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) URI with the
`boxparam` filled with the Asset Metadata Box Name, equal to the _Asset ID_ (encoded
as `base64url`).

> The complete Asset Metadata [ARC-82](./arc-0082.md) URI for the ASA `12345` would
> be interpreted as:
>
> `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=MDk=`

### [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) Compliance

The compliance with [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) is **OPTIONAL** but **RECOMMENDED**, to
ensure interoperability with existing infrastructures, such as explorers and wallets,
and other applications.

If the ASA conforms to [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md), then:

- The ASA **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3 ASA Parameters Conventions_](./arc-0003.md#asa-parameters-conventions)
for the _Asset Name_ (`an`) and the _Asset URL_ (`au`) fields.

  - The **RECOMMENDED** _Asset URL_ (`au`) for an [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) ASA is:
  `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=#arc3`

- The Asset Metadata **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3 JSON Metadata File Schema_](./arc-0003.md#json-metadata-file-schema).

- If the Asset Metadata are _immutable_, the ASA **MUST** comply with the [_ARC-3
ASA Parameters Conventions_](./arc-0003.md#asa-parameters-conventions) for the _Asset
Metadata Hash_ (`an`) field.

## Rationale

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

TBD

## Reference Implementation

### Usage

The clients **MUST** use the Algod API endpoint to retrieve the Asset Metadata.

> A minimal Python SDK example is provided with the [reference implementation]().

#### Example: Get [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) Asset Metadata

> Given the ASA with the _Asset ID_ `12345`, the client:
>
> 1. Calls the Algod API [GetAssetByID](https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/#getassetbyid
> endpoint to get the _Asset URL_ field (`url`) from the response and drops the
> `#arc3` suffix (if present), obtaining: `algorand://app/<singleton_arc89_app_id>?box=`;
>
> 1. Extracts the _Application ID_ (`<singleton_arc89_app_id>`) and encodes the _Asset
> ID_ as Asset Metadata Box Name (`<asset_id>`);
>
> 1. Calls the Algod API [GetApplicationBoxByName](https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-api/algod/#getapplicationboxbyname
> endpoint to get the content of the _Asset Metadata Box_ from the response:
>
> ```shell
> curl -X GET http://localhost/v2/applications/<singleton_arc89_app_id>/box?name=<asset_id> \
>  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
>  -H 'X-Algo-API-Token: API_KEY'
> ```
>
> The `value` field of the response contains the Asset [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) JSON
> Metadata.

## Security Considerations

The authorization over the Asset Metadata update and delete is granted to the Asset
Manager to preserve the ASA trust model. The authorization is not granted to the
Asset Creator, since this role could be performed programmatically by Applications
and is not supposed to be the long-lasting maintainer of the ASA.
