# Extend arc-4 to add `read-only` annotation to methods

## Summary

The following document introduces a convention for creating methods (as described in [ARC-4](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0004.md)) which don't mutate state.

## Abstract

The goal of this convention is to allow smart contract developers to distinguish between methods which mutate state and methods which don't by introducing a new property to the `Method` descriptor.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

> Comments like this are non-normative.

## Read-only functions

A `read-only` function is a function with no side-effects. In particular, a `read-only` function **SHOULD NOT** include:
- local/global state modifications
- calls to non `read-only` functions
- inner-transactions

It is **RECOMMENDED** for a `read-only` function to not access transactions in a group or metadata of the group.

> The goal is to allow algod to easily execute `read-only` functions without broadcasting a transaction

In order to support this annotation, the following `Method` descriptor is suggested:
```typescript
interface Method {
  /** The name of the method */
  name: string;
  /** Optional, user-friendly description for the method */
  desc?: string;
  /** Optional, is it a read-only method (accroding to ARC-22) */
  readonly?: boolean
  /** The arguments of the method, in order */
  args: Array<{
    /** The type of the argument */
    type: string;
    /** Optional, user-friendly name for the argument */
    name?: string;
    /** Optional, user-friendly description for the argument */
    desc?: string;
  }>;
  /** Information about the method's return value */
  returns: {
    /** The type of the return value, or "void" to indicate no return value. */
    type: string;
    /** Optional, user-friendly description for the return value */
    desc?: string;
  };
}
```
