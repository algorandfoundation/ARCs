# Algorand Wallet Contextual KeyGen and Signing

## Abstract

This document specifies an expansion of the Algorand Wallet API to support contextual key generation and signing for **non-algorand-transaction** contexts.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative.

### Overview

> This overview section is non-normative.

At a high level this specification defines a new API to generate keys and signing in other contexts than transactions.

> Interfaces are defined in TypeScript. All the objects that are defined are valid JSON objects.

#### Contexts

An enum of contexts that are supported by the wallet. This enum is extensible and can be expanded in the future to support more contexts (i.e messaging, ephemeral keys, other chain derivations, etc)

```ts
enum KeyContext {
    Address = 0, // Otherwise known as Account?
    Identity = 1,
    ...
}
```

#### BIP44 Context Derivation Paths

There is several reasons why we want to avoid key re-use in different contexts. One of the reasons is that we want to avoid the possibility of **leaking** information about the identity of the user. Another reason is that there is some cryptographic security concers when re-using keys or in case of keys being compromised the impact is **compartmentalized**.

For this reason is advisable to have different derivation paths for different contexts supporting recoveribility of the keys by using the same mnemonic as before.

| Purpose | Coin Type | Account | Change | Address Index |    Context    |
| :-----: | :-------: | :-----: | :----: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|   44'   |   283'    |   x'    |   x    |       x       |   Addresses   |
|   44'   |    0'     |   x'    |   x    |       x       | Identity Keys |

see <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki"> `BIP-44` </a>

#### Wallet New Interface

This new interface is for the wallet to implement. It is an extension of the current wallet interface.

This extension is **OPTIONAL** and separate from the current interface that handles address generation and transaction signing.

```ts
interface Wallet {
    ...
    keyGen(context: KeyContext, account:number, keyIndex: number): Promise<Uint8Array>;
    signData(context: KeyContext, account:number, keyIndex: number, message: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array>;
    ECDH(context: KeyContext, account: number, keyIndex: number, otherPartyPub: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array>
    ...
}
```

##### keyGen

Wallet API function method that derives a key in a given context. The key should be derived from the wallet's master key. The key derivation should be deterministic, meaning that the same key should be derived from the same context and name.

In order to derive a key, the wallet should lookup the different derivation paths for the given context.

- **method name**: `keyGen`
- **parameters**:

  - `context`: The context of the key to be generated
  - `account`: The account index to be used for key derivation. The value value should be hardened as per BIP44
  - `keyIndex`: The key index to be used for key derivation.

- **returns**: Byte array cointaing the public key, which is a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve. The public key is encoded as compressed EC point: the y-coordinate, combined with the lowest bit (the parity) of the x-coordinate, making up 32 bytes.

###### Example

```ts
const identityKey: Uint8Array = await wallet.keyGen(KeyContext.Identity, 0, 0);
```

##### sign

Signing operation that can be used to perform arbitrary signing operations in a given context. These can be for example:

    - Identity signatures (Documents, DIDs, etc)
    - Address signatures (i.e Signing auth challenges)

The function should check if the data, before and after decoding, isn't a regular Algorand transaction. If it is, the function should throw an error.

- **method name**: `sign`
- **parameters**:
  - `data`: The data to be signed
  - `context`: The context of the key to be used for signing
  - `account`: The account index to be used for key derivation. The value value should be hardened as per BIP44
  - `keyIndex`: The key index to be used for key derivation.
  - `metadata`: Object to describe the type of data that is being signed. It should specify the encoding used (i.e msgpack, cbor, etc) and a schema so that the wallet can decode it to show the user.
    - `encoding`: The encoding used for the data
    - `schema`: The schema of the data in the form of a JSON schema. The schemas are an powerful tool for wallet providers to be able to enforce the type and format of the data that is being signed. You can check schema examples <a href= "https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/tree/main/assets/arc-0052/schemas">here</a>.
- **returns**: Byte array containing the signature. The signature is encoded as a 64-byte array (32 + 32 bytes). It holds a compressed point R + the integer s (confirming that the signer knows the msg and the privKey).
  - Throws error if data doesn't match the schema

###### Example

```ts
const message = {
  letter: "Hello World",
};

const encoded: Buffer = Buffer.from(to_base64(JSON.stringify(message)));

// Schema of what we are signing
const jsonSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    letter: {
      type: "string",
    },
  },
};

const metadata: SignMetadata = {
  encoding: Encoding.BASE64,
  schema: jsonSchema,
};

const signature: Uint8Array = await cryptoService.signData(
  KeyContext.Address,
  0,
  0,
  encoded,
  metadata
);
expect(signature).toHaveLength(64);
```

##### ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)

This operation is used to perform a secret key aggrement between two parties. This is useful for example for deriving a shared symmetric secret that is only known between the participants.

The symmetric secret can be used for encrypting and decrypting messages.

- **method name**: `ECDH`
- **parameters**:
  - `context`: The context of the key to be used for signing
  - `account`: The account index to be used for key derivation. The value value should be hardened as per BIP44
  - `keyIndex`: The key index to be used for key derivation.
  - `otherPartyPub`: The public key of the other party
- **returns**: Byte array containing the shared secret. The shared secret is a 32-byte array.

###### Example

```ts
const aliceKey: Uint8Array = await cryptoService.keyGen(
  KeyContext.Address,
  0,
  0
);

const bobKey: Uint8Array = await cryptoService.keyGen(KeyContext.Address, 0, 1);

const aliceSharedSecret: Uint8Array = await cryptoService.ECDH(
  KeyContext.Address,
  0,
  0,
  bobKey
);

const bobSharedSecret: Uint8Array = await cryptoService.ECDH(
  KeyContext.Address,
  0,
  1,
  aliceKey
);

// Same secret can be used to encrypt by Alice and decrypt by Bob
//and vice-versa
expect(aliceSharedSecret).toEqual(bobSharedSecret);
```

## Rationale

At it's core, blockchain keys and signatures are just implementations of cryptographic primitives. These primitives can be used for a wide variety of use cases, not just for the purpose of signing transactions. And wallets being applications that contain or serve as Key Management Systems (KMS), should be able to support a multiple of other use cases that are not just related to transactions. This creates the possibility of attaching on-chain behavior with off-chain behavior, allowing for example to concepts of Identity and Authentication.

The current wallet APIs available only support key derivation for addresses and signing for transactions. In the broader context of Algorand and web3 ecosystems, there is a need for a more flexible API that allows for contextual key generation and signing. An example of this could be identity dedicated keys (i.e DIDs), or passkeys for authentication.

## Reference Implementation

Reference Implementation is included in the `assets` folder <a href= "https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/tree/main/assets/arc-0052">here</a>.

## Security Considerations

As this functionality is based on EdDSA, BIP32 HD derivations and ECDH, the security considerations of those specifications apply. Particularly, the Ed25519 derived keys must be clamped to avoid known attacks
