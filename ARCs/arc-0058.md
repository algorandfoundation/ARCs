## Abstract
This ARC proposes a standard for using stateful applications and rekey transactions to enable account abstraction on Algorand. The abstracted account is controlled by a single stateful application which is the auth address of the abstracted account. Other applications can be used as plugin to provide additional functionality to the abstracted account.

## Motivation
Manually signing transactions for every dApp interaction can be rather fatiguing for the end-user, which results in a frustrating UX. In some cases, it makes specfific app designs that require a lot of transactions borderline impossible without delegation or an escrow account.

Another common point of friction for end-users in the Algorand ecosystem is ASA opt-in transactions. This is a paticularly high point of friction for onboarding new accounts since they must be funded and then initiate a transaction. This standard can be used to allow mass creation of non-custodial accounts and trigger opt-ins on their behalf.

## Specification

### Definitions
**External Owned Account (EOA)** - An account that is NOT controlled by a smart contract.

**Abstracted Account** - An account that has functionality beyond a typical keypair-based account.

**Abstracted Account App** - The stateuful application used to control the abstracted account. This app's address is the `auth-addr` of the abstracted account.

**Plugin** - An additional application that adds functionality to the **Abstracted Account App** (and thus the **Abstracted Account**).

**Admin** - An account, sepererate from the **Abstracted Account**, that controls the **Abstracted Account App**. In patiular, this app can initiate rekeys, add plugins, and transfer admin.


### [ARC-4](./arc-0004.md) Methods

An abstracted app account that adheres to this standard **MUST** implement the following methods

### Plugins
Plugins are applications that the abstracted account applicaiton **MUST** rekey to when `rekeyToPlugin` or `rekeyToNamedPlugin` is called. After a plugin has been rekeyed to, the abstracted account **MUST** be rekeyed back to the abstracted account application. When and how this rekey is done does not matter, but it **MUST** be verified by a call `verifyAuthAddr` as the last transaction in the group OR the last transaction in the group must be an explicit rekey transaction.

#### Named Plugins

The admin can optionally add a named plugin to their abstracted account application. Any name that matches the regex `/^ARC\d+$/` **MUST** implement the interface(s) described in the respective ARC. The ARC number **MUST NOT** have any leading 0s.

### Wallet and dApp Support
TODO

## Rationale

### App vs Logic Sig
There have similar propsoals for reducing end-user friction, such as [ARC-47](./arc-0047.md) which enables safer usage of delegated logic signatures. The major downside of logic signatures is that they are not useable by smart contracts. This severely limits composability and potential use cases.

### Plugins
Rather than constantly updating the approval program of the abstracted account application to add functionality, it is safer and easier to simply add additional apps that enable the desired functionality. This also gives the end-user more control over what various dApps can do with their account at any time.

## Backwards Compatibility
Existing Algorand accounts can transition to an abstracted account by creating a new abstracted account application and setting the address to their current address. This requires them to create a new account to act as the admin.

End-users can use an abstracted account with any dApp provided they rekey the account to an externally owned account.

## Test Cases

TODO: Some functional tests are in this repo https://github.com/joe-p/account_abstraction.git

TODO: Migrate to ARC repo, but waiting until development has settled.

## Security Considerations
By adding a plugin to an abstracted account, that plugin can be called by anyone which will initiate a rekey from the abstracted account to the plugin app address. While the plugin must rekey back, there is no safeguards on what the plugin does when it has authority over the abstracted account. As such, extreme diligance must be taken by the end-user to ensure they are adding safe and/or trusted plugins. The security assumptions for plugins are very similar to delegated logic signatures, with the exception that plugins can always be revoked.
