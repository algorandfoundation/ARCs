# A0B001 - ASA2ASA Stateless orderbook smart contract

## Summary

This document introduce standard for P2P onchain orderbook smart contract.

## Abstract

The algorand blockchain is efficient decentralized smart contract capable blockchain. This standard introduces P2P trading opportunities with onchain orderbook capabilities. 

When a person wants to sell his asset, he can store his intention to the blockchain by creating logic signature smart contract where he states exact price he wants to receive, other asset he wants to receive and the quantity is determined in the amount of asset he supplies to the contract.

Owner of the asset is allowed to do with the contract anything except rekeying. Executing party is allowed to execute contract only at specified price by owner, and cannot close the asset nor account.

When person wants to buy asset, he executes the same contract with his sale intention from the other side.

Smart contract does not cast any royality fees to third party.

The contract is searchable on the blockchain by the logic sig prefix 05260203A0B001.

## Stateless vs statefull

This specification intend to provide stateless smart contract. 

Advantages of stateless:
- Requires 1 less transaction to call - no app call txs
- There is no central authority who can change contract behavior
- Much more simple logic

Advantages of statefull:
- Easier to find orders on the blockchain

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Variables

seller - Address of the owner of the asset
price - ulong price of the asset to receive. With multiplier can be used as a decimal representation.
multiplier - price divided by multiplier is human readable decimal representation of the price
assetSell - asset id to sell - to deposit to the contract with intention to receive other asset
assetBuy - asset id to buy - intention to receive the asset instead of the saling asset

### Price calculation

Executing price calculation MUST be exactly the same as intended price. 

Executing price CANNOT be higher than intended price for safety of the buyer.

Executing price CANNOT be lower than intended price for safety of the seller.

Price is verified in the teal logic as
```
gtxn 0 AssetAmount // 50000,000000
intc 0 // {{price}} // 1
mulw   // 50000,000000 .. returns two ints to stack high and low
store 2 // 50000,000000
store 1
gtxn 1 AssetAmount // 50,000000
intc 1  // {{multiplier}} // 1000
mulw    // 50000,000000
store 4 // 50000,000000
store 3
load 1

```

### Smart contract

Smart contract uses Handlebars variable replacements.

```
