# Algorand Application Metadata

> This API is a draft.  Some elements may change.

## Summary

A standard for a general metadata format for Algorand
_Applications_ (aka "smart contracts"), the _Application Specification_,
supporting integration and discovery scenarios.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**",
"**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**",
"**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

> Comments like this are non-normative.

## Definitions

* **Application:** an Algorand Application, aka "smart contract",
  "stateful contract", "contract", or "app".
* **Application Specification:** a metadata file describing the Application in both
  human and machine readable ways.
* **HLL:** a higher level language that compiles to TEAL bytecode.
* **dapp (frontend)**: a decentralized application frontend, interpreted here to
  mean an off-chain frontend (a webapp, native app, etc.) that interacts with
  Applications on the blockchain.
* **explorer**: an off-chain application that allows browsing the blockchain,
  showing details of transactions.
* **ABI**: a specification of the methods an Application offers.

## Note

The approach in this ARC document is to list goals or use cases, identify
information and format for each goal, then collate them into a single format.

The collated proposal is in the [Application Specification](#application-specification) section

As the discussion on this ARC continues and new use cases are found, it would
be helpful to list them here and extend the format in the same way.

## Overview

This document expands on [ARC-4](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0004.md) to
offer general Application metadata, supporting further use cases, and to offer
ways of linking Applications to their metadata files to support their
safe discovery.

The goals of [ARC-4](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0004.md) include support
for HLLs and for dapp authors to integrate with Applications. IDEs offer
the ability to generate proxy classes for different HLLs
based on metadata about the remote API to interface with. Examples include
SOAP WSDL, OpenAPI, and in future Algorand Application Specification metadata
will be used in similar ways. Absent IDEs or similar code generation
tools, dapp authors still also need a human readable document of the
Application in order to integrate.

An Application offers two types of interaction: application calls
and read-only named state variables (global and local). ARC-4 provides
information about the former but not the latter. It seems likely that
there will also be other types of metadata needed by Application consumers.
At the time of writing, for example,there are discussions around Application-
based NFTs and their metadata.

Whatever the content of those metadata files, consumers in the first
place need some way of discovering them. They also need to know that
the versions of both Application and Application Spec match.

## Goals

This section lists the goals and needs the Application Specification intends 
to achieve and fulfill.

1. Support tools and IDEs to automatically generate Application proxy classes, including ABI methods, base 'raw' methods and state variables.
2. The Application Specification format must be human readable and machine readable.
3. The Application Specification format must be extensible, to allow for inclusion of new ideas,
such as discovery tags, NFT specifications, and so on.
4. Support discovery by establishing a link between Applications and their corresponding
Application Specification files.
5. Composability: Applications may inherit behaviour from each other in different ways, such as
implementing interfaces, composing and wrapping other application, direct single inheritance and so on.

The below sections address the above goals, each adding some discussion
and relevant specification details.

### **1. IDE Support**

There are two general ways of interacting with an Application. One is by making an
application call transaction and the other is by reading global or local state.
The state variables are named.

An imaginary Application called SugarSupplierContract offers
a price for refined sugar to the public. This can be read from the
global state variable "SugarPrice." A retailer negotiates a discount
wholesale price. This is offered to the customer via a local state variable
called "YourPrice." The Application also offers a method to calculate 
the estimated shipping price for a given volume of sugar.

The retailer would like to be integrate with this SugarSupplierContract
using the development tool of their choice.

The retailer, in this scenario already has the Application Specification
available, so they give this to their IDE and the following proxy class is
generated. The below is just a C# example.

```cs
   public abstract class SugarSupplierContract : SmartContractReference
    {
        [Storage(StorageType.Global)]
        public ulong SugarPrice;

        [Storage(StorageType.Local)]
        public ulong YourPrice;

  
        public abstract ulong ShippingCost(ulong VolumeInKilos);
    } 
```

Proxies can support server or dapp (frontend) calls to an Algorand node
or even contract to contract invocations for compilers.

Even without the IDE to tooling support, a dapp author
still needs to understand how the SugarSupplierContract is intended
to be used, so information must be provided somehow.

To achieve this goal, this ARC document proposes that the
Application Specification include a single ARC-4 Contract
description, and that the ARC-4 Contract section be updated to
include locals and globals:

```typescript
interface Contract {
  /** A user-friendly name for the contract */
  name: string;
  /** Optional, user-friendly description for the interface */
  desc?: string;
  /**
   * Optional object listing the contract instances across different networks
   */
  networks?: {
    /**
     * The key is the base64 genesis hash of the network, and the value contains
     * information about the deployed contract in the network indicated by the
     * key
     */
    [network: string]: {
      /** The app ID of the deployed contract in this network */
      appID: number;
    }
  }
  /** All of the methods that the contract implements */
  methods: Method[];

  /** All local variables intended for consumption as part of this contract **/
  locals: Variable[];

  /** All global variables intended for consumption as part of this contract **/
  globals: Variable[];

}
```

There needs to be a _Variable_ specification too, following similar style as
the _Method_ entity:

```typescript
interface Variable {
  /** The name of the variable **/
  name: string;
  /** Optional, user-friendly description for the variable **/
  desc?: string;
  /** The type of the variable **/
  type: string;
}
```

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "SugarSupplierContract",
  "desc": "Sugar-Decentralised Inc.'s epic sugar contract. All our sugar is produced by people who only eat sugar! Sustainability is our middle name.",
  "networks": {
    "wGHE2Pwdvd7S12BL5FaOP20EGYesN73ktiC1qzkkit8=": { "appID": 1234 },
    "SGO1GKSzyE7IEPItTxCByw9x8FmnrCDexi9/cOUJOiI=": { "appID": 5678 }
  },
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "ShippingCost",
      "desc": "Get a sugar shipping quote here ",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "Volume in kilos" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "uint64", "desc": "Your shipping price in Algo" }
    }
  ],
  "locals": [ 
      {
      "name": "YourPrice",
      "desc": "Call the ShippingCost contract with proposed annual volume in the Note field to get a wholesaler price. ",
      "type": "uint64"
    }  
  ],
   "globals": [ 
      {
      "name": "SugarPrice",
      "desc": "Our public sugar retail price in Algo ",
      "type": "uint64"
    }  
  ]
}
```

### **2. Human and machine readability**

JSON formats, as above, are both human and machine readable.

The specification MUST always be both human and machine readable.

Extensions to this specification MUST NOT ever include machine-only or binary formats.

### **3. Extensibility**

It is difficult to know what the Application Specification will be expected
to contain in the future. One thing that is reasonably certain though
is that everyone would benefit if the information about the Application
was not scattered across different places in different formats.

It may not always be desirable to add information directly into the Application
Specification file either, in which case the file can be extended using
pointers to yet further resources, such as IPFS ids, URLs and so on.

The need for extensibility means that the modified _Contract_ element in 1 above
is insufficient as an Application Specification alone. This ARC proposes an
envelope as follows, again following a similar descriptive style as in ARC-4:

```typescript
interface ApplicationSpecification {

  /** The version  of the specification format **/
  specificationVersion: string;  

  /** The contract implemented by this Application **/
  contract: Contract;

  /** ARC extension 1**/
  extensionPoint1: SomeFutureExtension1; 

    ...

  /** ARC extension N**/
  extensionPoint2: SomeFutureExtensionN; 

}
```

This ARC proposes, therefore, that Application Specification
formats are versioned and subsequent ARCs increment the version number.

### **4. Discovery**

Consumers of an Application need to be able to find the Application Specification
for that version of it.

There are many potential 'user stories' around searching for different Applications.
We could speculate on various needs, such as:

* Search by a well known Interface name that the Application implements,
* Search by a tag,
* Search by a foreign language tag,
* Search if the Application is audited and by whom,
* By transaction fees,
* By a community 'star' rating,
* Etc.

It is difficult to know where to draw the line between what should be community
add-on, and what should be offered by the Algorand platform.

In any case, there are some important security considerations:

* The consumer needs to know that the Application author is the publisher
of the Application Specification.
* Whichever way the consumer obtains the Application ID on the
Algorand blockchain, they need a mechanism to find the corresponding
Application Specification.
* When peripheral directories and explorers of Application
metadata emerge, users may be exposed to phishing-type attacks where
they are misdirected to fake application clones (eg: T1nyman, spelt
with a 'one').

At a minimum then some kind of veriable link between Author, Application and
Specification needs to exist.

This ARC proposes the following:

1. Store the SHA-512/256 hash of the current Application Specification file
in the Application itself.
2. To save storage, declare a constant byte array, using _bytecblock_
that is of the format "APPSPEC{HASH}" where HASH is the 32 byte
hash of the file.
3. The first opcode in the ApprovalProgram program is where the
_bytecblock_ MUST be placed.

To support scenarios where the Application authors want to provide an 'official'
host for their Application Specifications, the Application itself MAY offer a URI
to the location of the ABI spec.

4. APPSPEC{HASH}{URI} where URI is the UTF-8 byte encoded URI to some locator
for the Application's spec.

To help support the scenarios where the consumer finds the Application Specification
file first, or wants to verify version numbers, the Application Specification
MUST include the following extension:

```typescript
interface Application {

  /** The corresponding Application id  **/
  appID: uint64;  

  /** The Application version  **/
  version: uint32;
  

}
```

### **5. Composability**

It may be desirable to build Contract elements through inheriting from another Contract
or implementing Interfaces.

TBD: For this version of the ARC there is no proposal for being able to reference
uniquely named interfaces from some external source. This would again involve a mechanism
for hashing and versioning some Interface file at external sources.

TBD: Aside from interfaces, and because of state variables, we may wish to offer
single inheritance from a parent contract. This could be a hash and optional 'official'
location.

## Application Specification

Collating from the goals section above, in addition to the protocol/Application
related proposals, and extending ARC-4 , the following specification and example is given:

```typescript
interface ApplicationSpecification {

  /** The version  of the specification format **/
  specificationVersion: string;  

  /** The corresponding application **/
  application: Application;

  /** The contract implemented by this Application **/
  contract: Contract;

  /** Example future extension **/
  extensionPoint1: SomeFutureExtension1; 

}
```

using:

```typescript
interface Application {

  /** The corresponding Application id  **/
  appID: uint64;  

  /** The Application version  **/
  version: uint32;
  

}
```

```typescript
interface Contract {
  /** A user-friendly name for the contract */
  name: string;
  /** Optional, user-friendly description for the interface */
  desc?: string;
  /**
   * Optional object listing the contract instances across different networks
   */
  networks?: {
    /**
     * The key is the base64 genesis hash of the network, and the value contains
     * information about the deployed contract in the network indicated by the
     * key
     */
    [network: string]: {
      /** The app ID of the deployed contract in this network */
      appID: number;
    }
  }
  /** All of the methods that the contract implements */
  methods: Method[];

  /** All local variables intended for consumption as part of this contract **/
  locals: Variable[];

  /** All global variables intended for consumption as part of this contract **/
  globals: Variable[];

}
```

using:

```typescript
interface Variable {
  /** The name of the variable **/
  name: string;
  /** Optional, user-friendly description for the variable **/
  desc?: string;
  /** The type of the variable **/
  type: string;
}
```

Example:

```json
{
    "specificationVersion": "1.0",
    "application":{
        "appID": 1234,
        "version":1
    },
    "contract": 
    {
        "name": "SugarSupplierContract",
        "desc": "Sugar-Decentralised Inc.'s epic sugar contract. All our sugar is produced by people who only eat sugar! Sustainability is our middle name.",
        "networks": {
            "wGHE2Pwdvd7S12BL5FaOP20EGYesN73ktiC1qzkkit8=": { "appID": 1234 },
            "SGO1GKSzyE7IEPItTxCByw9x8FmnrCDexi9/cOUJOiI=": { "appID": 5678 }
        },
        "methods": [
            {
            "name": "ShippingCost",
            "desc": "Get a sugar shipping quote here ",
            "args": [
                { "type": "uint64", "name": "a", "desc": "Volume in kilos" }
            ],
            "returns": { "type": "uint64", "desc": "Your shipping price in Algo" }
            }
        ],
        "locals": [ 
            {
            "name": "YourPrice",
            "desc": "Call the ShippingCost contract with proposed annual volume in the Note field to get a wholesaler price. ",
            "type": "uint64"
            }  
        ],
        "globals": [ 
            {
            "name": "SugarPrice",
            "desc": "Our public sugar retail price in Algo ",
            "type": "uint64"
            }  
        ]
    },
    "extensionPoint1":{
        "somethingNew":1234
    }
}

```
