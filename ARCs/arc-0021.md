# Round based datafeed oracles on Algorand

## Abstract

The following document introduces conventions for building round based datafeed oracles on Algorand using the ABI defined in [ARC-4](./arc-0004.md)

The goal of these conventions is to make it easier for smart-contracts to interact with off-chain data sources.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative.

An [ARC-21](./arc-0021.md) oracle **MUST** have an associated smart-contract implementaing the ABI interface described below.

### ABI Interface

Round based datafeed oracles allow smart-contracts to get data with relevancy to a specific block number, for example the ALGO price at a specific round.

The associated smart contract **MUST** implement the following ABI interface:
```json
{
  "name": "ARC_0021",
  "desc": "Interface for a round based datafeed oracle",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "get",
      "desc": "Get data from the oracle for a specific round",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "round", "desc": "The desired round" },
        { "type": "byte[]", "name": "user_data", "desc": "Optional: Extra data provided by the user. Pass an empty slice if not used." }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "byte[]", "desc": "The oracle's response. If the data doesn't exist, the response is an empty slice." }
    },
    {
      "name": "must_get",
      "desc": "Get data from the oracle for a specific round. Panics if the data doesn't exist.",
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "round", "desc": "The desired round" },
        { "type": "byte[]", "name": "user_data", "desc": "Optional: Extra data provided by the user. Pass an empty slice if not used." }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "byte[]", "desc": "The oracle's response" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Method boundaries

- Both `get` and `mustGet` functions **MUST NOT** use local state.
- Optional arguements of type `byte[]` that are not used are expected to be passed as an empty byte slice.

## Rationale

## Security Considerations

None.
