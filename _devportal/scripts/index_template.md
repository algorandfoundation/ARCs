## ARC Status Terms
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Idea</strong> - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked
    within the ARC Repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Draft</strong> - The first formally tracked stage of an ARC in
    development. An ARC is merged by an ARC Editor into the ARC repository when
    properly formatted.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review</strong> - An ARC Author marks an ARC as ready for and
    requesting Peer Review.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review window for an ARC
    before moving to FINAL. An ARC editor will assign Last Call status and set a
    review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this
    period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the ARC to
    Review.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Final</strong> - This ARC represents the final standard. A Final ARC
    exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata
    and add non-normative clarifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any ARC in Draft or Review if inactive for a
    period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An ARC may be
    resurrected from this state by Authors or ARC Editors through moving it back
    to Draft.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The ARC Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed
    ARC. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this ARC
    number. If the idea is pursued at a later date it is considered a new
    proposal.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deprecated</strong> - This ARC has been deprecated.
    It has been replaced by another one or is now obsolete.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Living</strong> - A special status for ARCs that are designed to be
    continually updated and not reach a state of finality.
  </li>
</ul>
