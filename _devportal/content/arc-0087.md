## Abstract

Adopt a standard key name specification for complex data. 

This defines key names that can be used to represent JSON,
Blobs, or other structures that do not fit neatly into the state

## Motivation

This pattern has emerged over time as a way to circumvent constraints with state storage.
This seeks to codify the practice into a shared definition which can be leveraged as a primitive in the ecosystem.

This greatly simplifies the cross-cutting concerns
when integrating with complex structures by directly addressing values on-chain.


## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> All bullet points are in reference to Key Names

- **SHOULD** be prefixed with `o_` (for discovery/indexing)
- **MUST** separate nested object keys with `.` 
- **MUST** index collections with `[N]`
- **SHALL** be escaped by starting with `${` and ending in `}`

## Rationale

Multiple variants of this pattern create downstream cycles which could be avoided.

### JSON/Objects

Given the following object:

```json
{
  "alice": "APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE",
  "bob": "BX2RWWE77PA7JNNIPWUBQYX44LDHDE6EBRFEPLJUOMBNLT4ATQ3SA7UGEQ",
  "metadata": {
    "rp": "algorand.co"
  }
}
```

Represents the following Key/Value pairs:

| key           | value                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| o_alice       | APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE |
| o_bob         | BX2RWWE77PA7JNNIPWUBQYX44LDHDE6EBRFEPLJUOMBNLT4ATQ3SA7UGEQ |
| o_metadata.rp | algorand.co                                                |


### Blob/File

Assuming the blob is greater than the state storage, 
chunking is required and can be represented in an object

```json
{
  "index": 2,
  "mime": "text/plain",
  "blobs": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

Would produce the following keys

| key        | value      |
|------------|------------|
| o_index    | 2          |
| o_mime     | text/plain |
| o_blobs[0] | ...        |
| o_blobs[1] | ...        |

This is only illustrative of the value size constraints, 
a dedicated specification would be more robust for bespoke Objects. 
This is out of scope for this key name specification. 

### Templatization

Assuming the key names are greater than 64 bytes,
mapping of the names to values is required.

```json
{
  "this is a really long key that for some reason is extra long even though it probably doesn't need to be this long but idk maybe someone has a key this long": "data for super long key"
}
```

Would produce the following keys

| key                | value                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| o_${path.to.value} | data for super long key |

This is only illustrative of the key size constraints,
a dedicated specification would be more robust for applying templates.
This is out of scope for this key name specification.

### Encoding/[ARC-4](/arc-standards/arc-0004) Containers

Assuming the values are encoded,
further processing is required with knowledge of the types

```json
{
  "APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE": [0,1,2,3,...]
}
```

Given the value type

```typescript
class PackedValue extends Struct<{
    a: uint64
    b: uint64
}> {}
```

Would be represented as the following object

```json
{
  "APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE": {
    "a": 1234,
    "b": 1234
  }
}
```

And would produce the following keys

| key                                                          | value |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| o_APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE | bytes |


This is only illustrative of the current encoding practices,
a mapping of ARC-4 Containers to key paths could be done at a future date.
This is out of scope for this key name specification.

## Backwards Compatibility

All backwards compatibility must be done with an Adapter.
