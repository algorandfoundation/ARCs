<h2>ARC status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Idea</strong> - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the ARC Repository.
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - The first formally tracked stage of an ARC in development. An ARC is merged by an ARC Editor into the ARC repository when properly formatted.</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> - An ARC Author marks an ARC as ready for and requesting Peer Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review window for an ARC before moving to FINAL. An ARC editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the ARC to Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - This ARC represents the final standard. A Final ARC exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any ARC in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An ARC may be resurrected from this state by Authors or ARC Editors through moving it back to Draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The ARC Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed ARC. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this ARC number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Living</strong> - A special status for ARCs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably ARC-1.</li>
</ul>
